        <h2>By John Clare</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>

    <div class="section_1">
        <p>And what is Life?—An hour-glass on the run,<br/>
            A Mist retreating from the morning sun,<br/>
            A busy, bustling, still repeated dream;<br/>
            A minute's pause, a moment's thought;<br/>
            And happiness?—A bubble on the stream,<br/>
            That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line_2"></div>

    <div class="section_2">
        <p>What are vain Hopes?—The puffing gale of morn,<br/>
            That of its charms divests the dewy lawn,<br/>
            And robs each flow'ret of its gem,—and dies;<br/>
             A cobweb hiding disappointment's thorn,<br/>
        Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line_3"></div>


    <div class="section_3">
        <p>And thou, O Trouble?—nothing can suppose,<br/>
            <i>(And sure the power of wisdom only knows,)</i><br/>
                What need requireth thee:<br/>
            So free and liberal as thy bounty flows,<br/>
                Some necessary cause must surely be:<br/>
            But disappointments, pains, and every woe<br/>
                Devoted wretches feel,<br/>
            The universal plagues of life below,<br/>
                Are mysteries still 'neath Fate's unbroken seal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line_4"></div>

    <div class="section_4">
        <p>And what is Death? is still the cause unfound?<br/>
            That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?—<br/>
                A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave.<br/>
            And Peace? where can its happiness abound?—<br/>
                No where at all, save heaven, and the grave.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line_5"></div>

    <div class="section_5">
        <p>Then what is Life?—When stripp'd of its disguise,<br/>
            A thing to be desir'd it cannot be;<br/>
        Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes<br/>
            Gives proof sufficient of its vanity.<br/>
        'Tis but a trial all must undergo;<br/>
            To teach unthankful mortals how to prize<br/>
        That happiness vain man's denied to know,<br/>
            Until he's call'd to claim it in the skies.</p>
